# SolarPV-Simulator
A Python 3 Project to model the operation of an off grid Solar Power System in order to define correct sizing information.

## Project Objective
Develop an open-sourced globally relevant Solar Photovoltaic System design tool that accurately simulates Solar PV system performance based on realistic, industry approved component models, analytical equations, and localized solar irradiance estimates, weather conditions, panel position and angle, load variability, as well as grid interconnectivity.  Using the tool, will allow the design of a complete solar PV system.  The tool should yield a solar PV system design that has a high degree of confidence of being able to satisfy client needs under real-world conditions experienced at the installation site.

## User Requirements
The following is a list of features and/or attributes that the solution must satisfy.

1. **no cost** – the model must be developed utilizing free resources, openly available to all without licensing or usage fees/charges.

2. **platform independence** – the model must be capable of operation from any modern computer platform to include: Windows, Mac, and Linux

3. **geographic scope** – the model must support system designs slated for installation anywhere in the world.

4. **promote learning** – the model must promote good design practice and engineering thinking by its users without adding overwhelming complexity or usage difficulty

5. **wide-spread component support** – the model must accept use of all PV system components by modeling device behavior based on recognized manufacturer's specifications and/or data sheet information.

6. **open source** – the mathematical analysis performed by the modeling tool must be openly available and easily modified.

7. **realistic** – the model must produce system performance results that are realistic with respect to the real-world environment in which the system is expected to be operated.

8. **on-going support** – in that the model must be developed on a platform with demonstrated long-term industry-wide support to ensure the availability of the tool in the future.
